# Module 2 - Using React via CDN

CDN - Context Delivery Networks
CDN for React.js & ReactDOM

``` html

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

```
Why two packages?
- React package has logic that is valid across web and moblie applications
- ReactDOM is for handling the DOM manipulations.
